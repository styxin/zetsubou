Zetsubo No Shima Easter Egg: Step 1: Complete the skulls and obtain the skull of Nan Sapwe. 

 Step 2: Have every player complete their trials. (Must be done for step 8) 

 Step 3: Build the shield and gas mask. (Shield needed for step 8 and gas mask for step 9) 

 Step 4: Build the KT-4 and upgrade it. (Must be built for step 6 and upgraded for the final boss) Note: Steps 1-4 do not have to be done in order but must be done for certain future steps.  

Note: PAP parts: Under water next to power switch, underwater in dirt tunnel, and inside the dead body bags.  

Note: Make sure you have equipped the "Anywhere But Here" gobblegum.  

Note: Shield parts spawn below in Lab A, trees around Lab B, and around the bunker/AA gun.  

Note: Gas mask parts spawn behind lab B next to the green irradiated water (area), next to the plane engine trap in that area, and in the "docks" area where a skull placement table can be found.  

Step 5: Mesmerize the paper on the wall next to the pink 115 rock in the body bag room. Make your way to the entrance of the bunker room (just left of the elevator) and mesmerize that wall.  

Step 6: Find all 3 gears for the machine to activate the elevator. The first gear is from the plane you can shoot down. To shoot it down, get an artillery shell from a plant by putting a seed in it and watering it with rainbow water and shooting the plant with the KT-4 every round until it gives you the shell. Then shoot down the plane with the AA gun when it comes around and collect the piece.  

Step 7: Second gear piece is in a secret room that can only be accessed by using the "Anywhere But Here" gobble gum when you are inside the room with the giant spider. Other places may also work for this.  

Step 8: Trials need to be done for this step. Charge your riot shield with periodic lightning strikes and melee, with the shield, the zip line box, then use the zip line, and knife 3/4 of the way there to land on the pier and collect the third gear piece. 

 Step 9 (Final Step): Place all the gears in the elevator, then go down the elevator once you're suited up and ready for the boss fight. For this step you must have the upgraded KT-4 to shoot and weaken the boss. The boss is a tree like monster that periodically exposes its orange weak spots, and those spots must be shot with the upgraded KT-4. Endure this for a while, while also being attacked by a combination of zombies, thrashers, and spiders. Cutscene will commence upon completion.
